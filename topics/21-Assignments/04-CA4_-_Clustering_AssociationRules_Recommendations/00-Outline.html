		<h1>Analysing a database of streaming activity</h1>
<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>The purpose of this assessment is to give students the opportunity to show what
they have learned in the module by discovering knowledge in databases
(classical data mining). In this assessment, students are asked to perform
<em>clustering</em> and <em>association analysis</em> and to <em>generate recommendations</em>.</p>
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>Data was collected from real users in relation to their streaming activity. The
raw data was shared with the ML community. The basic idea is that</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Creators</em> produce <em>Content</em></li>
<li><em>Users</em> consume <em>Content</em></li>
<li>The service provider (which provided the dataset) streams the <em>Content</em> to <em>Users</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relatively little contextual data was provided, mainly to protect user privacy.</p>
<p>We improved the dataset as follows. We</p>
<ol>
<li>took the combination of data dumps and clarified the relationships between
entities by deriving numeric keys and their relationships (rather than relying
on string matching).</li>
<li>derived per-user usage metrics, so users can be compared on a wider set
of features without compromising their privacy.</li>
<li>grouped the consumption patterns into <em>sessions</em> made up of a sequence of
<em>streams</em>.</li>
<li>filtered the data into a smaller, more manageable but still interesting,
subset.</li>
</ol>
<p>Different extracts from this dataset will be used to perform each of the three
tasks.</p>
<p>Specific tasks are set, relating to how the analysis is set up, how to
configure the machine learning techniques, and how to interpret and/or improve
the results.</p>
<h2>Detailed specification</h2>
<p>A detailed specification has been prepared in the format of a python notebook
for each task.</p>
<p>This includes advice on how to obtain the data and how to perform some initial
processing so that the data is ready for the next stage of processing.</p>
<p>Clustering, association analysis and recommendation tasks are specified and students
are asked to investigate the data using these approaches. If a student wishes
to add extra forms of analysis which prove enlightening, bonus marks might be
added, but the core tasks should be attempted at the very least.</p>
<p>For more details, please refer to the <code>CA4-Clus_spec.ipynb</code>,
<code>CA4-ARM_spec.ipynb</code> and <code>CA4-RS_spec.ipynb</code> notebooks included with the
moodle activity.</p>
<p>Students should submit 3 notebooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>studentId-StudentName-CA4_Clus.ipynb</code></li>
<li><code>studentId-StudentName-CA4_ARM.ipynb</code></li>
<li><code>studentId-StudentName-CA4_RS.ipynb</code></li>
</ul>
<p>where <code>studentId</code> is replaced with their 8-digit student number and
<code>StudentName</code> would be something like 'JohnOShea'. Students should also submit
any supporting files, so that their notebooks can be run. Students <em>should NOT</em>
upload the data files provided with the assignment, unless their notebook
assumes the data is placed somewhere other than in a data/ subfolder.</p>
<h2>What to do next</h2>
<p>Students are advised to refer to each specification notebook, make their own
copy (using the naming convention) and familiarise themslves with the data
<em>before</em> attempting each subtask.</p>
<h2>Format of submissions</h2>
<p>Students are asked to submit three Jupyter notebooks, one for each main task of
the assessment, together with any supporting resources needed to run the
analysis.  If you use any additional python packages, please indicate where
they can be found too.</p>
<p>Students are reminded to use the markdown cells in their notebooks to explain
their reasoning, discuss outputs and report on the progress of their data
investigation.  Students are also advised to use both tabular and plotted
output to present their work. Each notebook should read like a technical
report, with all findings supported by evidence.</p>
<p>A common pattern in Jupyter notebooks is to present each stage of the analysis
as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>set the scene, describe what needs to be done and what you expect to see</li>
<li>use the (python-based) tools to conduct the analysis</li>
<li>generate metrics, tables, plots and similar output to indicate what happened</li>
<li>discuss the output, highlighting the main points and anything that surprised
  you and/or will be needed in later steps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submission mode and Deadline</h2>
<p>Assignment attempts should be uploaded via the Moodle submission page. Students
can upload as often as they wish, but should remember to <em>submit</em> the version
they wish us to grade.</p>
<p>The deadline for submission is <strong>Wednesday 7 May 2025 at 21:00</strong>.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Data Description and task mapping</h2>
<p>The data is presented in 6 files, which are related to each other as shown in
the following Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).</p>
<p><img alt="Data files represented as tables in a relational database" src="files/ERD.png" /></p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Referring to the ERD above,</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary keys are indicated in bold font and key relationshis are shown as
  arrows</li>
<li><code>numUser</code> is the number of users associated with this <code>contentId</code> or
  <code>creatorId</code></li>
<li>Each item of content has a known duration (in seconds)</li>
<li><code>firstPlayed</code> is the timestamp that any content from that <code>creatorId</code> was
  played</li>
<li><code>numPlays</code> is the number of times a user played that <code>contentId</code>, or any
  content from that <code>creatorId</code></li>
<li><code>rating</code> takes a value between 1 and 5, where higher rating values indicate
  more user satisfaction with that <code>contentId</code> or that <code>creatorId</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>UserItems</code> table is the most detailed table, and has been annotated with
  <code>sessionId</code> and <code>streamId</code>.</li>
<li>A series of consecutive consumption events constitutes a <code>session</code>, with the
  order the <code>contentId</code>s are consumed indicated by the <code>streamId</code> in that
  <code>sessionId</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of the data in each task</h3>
<h4>Task Group 1 - Clustering</h4>
<p>This task uses the <code>User</code> "table", and the goal is to cluster the users based on
their similarity. Each <code>userId</code> has a small number of demographic features
(<code>gender</code> and <code>countryId</code>) and a larger number of behavioural attributes. The
users were chosen based on their compatible streaming behaviour, but there
is still a lot of variability.</p>
<h4>Task Group 2 - Association Rules Mining</h4>
<p>This task uses the <code>UserItems</code> "table", which is interpreted as a series of
transactions.  The transaction is referenced using a combination of <code>userId</code>
and <code>sessionId</code>, and the basket of items per transaction is indicated by either
the <code>creatorId</code>s (equivalent to brands) or the <code>contentId</code>s (equivalent to
purchased items) for that <code>userId</code>,<code>sessionId</code> combination.</p>
<h4>Task Group 3 - Recommendation Systems</h4>
<p>This task uses the <code>UserCreator</code> "table", which indicates how each <code>userId</code> has
rated the content from each of the <code>creatorId</code>s that they have streamed and
consumed. The data is thus in a format suitable for collaborative filtering.</p>
<h4>General</h4>
<p>Other data is provided in support of your EDA activities, to help your
understanding.</p>
