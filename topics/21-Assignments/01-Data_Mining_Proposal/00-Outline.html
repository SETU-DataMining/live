		<h1>Data Mining Proposal</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Each student is asked to create a proposal for a Data Mining project.</p>
<p>The proposal can relate to work or personal interest. In previous years, students have often chosen subjects that are topical.</p>
<p>The expected length will be approximately 1000 words, supplemented with tables, schematic diagrams, etc., as desired.</p>
<p>The proposal should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Background and motivation</li>
<li>Discussion of the types of questions you wish to answer (See week 1, 2 and 3)</li>
<li>Discussion of the data - where it comes from, missing data, interesting features (see Week 2 and Week 3)</li>
<li>How you propose to conduct the data investigation - (see Week 1)</li>
<li>Comment on the ethical aspects (if any) of the proposal topic - (see Week 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>No programming is required, but you might find it easier to look at example data that way, if you have example data to hand. Many students will not have such data so they will need to use other ways of explaining what the data might contain.</p>
<p>The assessment will be worth 20% of your final marks.</p>
<p>The deadline will be Sunday 15 February at 21:00hrs</p>
<p>If that deadline does not work for any student, please let us know - we will try to find an agreed alternative but <em>only if there is a good cause</em>. In general, late submission, without a strong justification, will incur a penalty.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>There is plenty of room for professional judgment. To keep the scope manageable, it is better to think of the project as an <em>initial/scoping investigation</em> based on available data.
The proposal is a once off: <em>there is no expectation that it will be the subject of future work in this module.</em></p>
<h2>Marking Scheme</h2>
<p>Students might find the following marking scheme useful.</p>
<p>Within the assignment, marks are assigned as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aims and description of the problem area (10)</li>
<li>Why the data investigation is needed (10)</li>
<li>What resources (data, expertise, etc.) are needed to be successful (10)</li>
<li>Outline of the proposed analysis (10)</li>
<li>What data mining steps are needed and why (10)</li>
<li>Choice of process model and its justification (5)</li>
<li>How the data is stored (5)</li>
<li>How data might be prepared for analysis (10)</li>
<li>What features might be used, with justification (10)</li>
<li>How the model might be validated (10)</li>
<li>How the model might be used in practice (10)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Advice</h2>
<h3>If you don’t have data yet....</h3>
<p>Perhaps you could describe what data you would like to have. Think about what questions you would like to answer. If you are looking for something that changes over time, is it a continuing effect or is it triggered by one or more events? Perhaps you are tracking incidence of a disease - where or how would that data be collected? What other attributes would be captured at the same time - data on other health conditions, demographics etc.? Could that data be helpful too? Would the data be structured or unstructured? How would you deal with missing data? If you were also interested in general data on the population - where might that come from, are there limitations/restrictions and what aspects are you interested in and why?</p>
<h3>If you have the data you describe....</h3>
<p>What would you do with this data? Do you want to assign some sort of score? Are you looking for natural groupings? Do you want to recommend particular interventions? When you have made up your mind, how would you prepare the data? If you can say anything about the algorithm you would use, or how it would be developed and deployed (e.g., by epidemiologists, GP surgeries, etc.) that would help. How would you decide whether data mining had come up with a good solution in your case? Even if we have not covered the algorithms in detail yet, you might be able to indicate how you might validate purely on cost grounds.</p>
<h3>How to maximise your marks</h3>
<p>Most of the marks (more than 70%) are given for evidence of alignment with the module. This covers everything from process models to model building. Don’t overlook practical concerns, e.g., those relating to storage and infrastructure. Looking at weeks 1-4, how can each student use what we have covered to make the technical justification for their proposal stronger?</p>
<p>Of course, not all of the module will be relevant to each proposal, but we strongly suspect that a lot of it will be relevant to most proposals. Students need to highlight the parts that are....</p>
<p><strong>Students are recommended to structure their submissions to align with the marking scheme. If that is not possible, they should highlight the relevant parts of their report, to make it clear that they have addressed all the requirements.</strong></p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>Regarding word count, this is intended as a guide. If you find you need to write more, you should add tables, diagrams or plots instead of text. The word limit is intended to set student expectation: this is an outline proposal, providing a summary of the technical justification for a data mining project. If students are writing much more than 1000 words, they are either providing more detail than is needed, or they are adding content that is irrelevant to the aims of the brief.</p>
<p>For students who do not have easy access to data, we are open to proposals that are more speculative: if we had data X (describing its characteristics), we could use techniques Y (outlining them) in data investigation Z (justifying the need and outlining what the results might be and how they would be evaluated). You do not need deep domain knowledge: an interest in the topic would probably be more than enough!</p>
<h3>Handling image data</h3>
<p>If your proposal concerns image analysis, the same datamining procedures would apply to image data, although you would probably stage them differently. For example, the raw pixel data would be very high-dimensional so would need special treatment (possibly in the form of dimensionality reduction). Or you could do some segmentation, edge detection, object detection, etc. and treat the outputs of these as features - it depends on your objectives and hence is something you could discuss in your proposal.</p>
<p>Summarising, data mining would be part of the image analysis workflow, and its place/role in that workflow depends on your objectives.</p>
<h3>Dealing with missing data</h3>
<p>You need to collect descriptive statistics first (such as: what columns have missing values, where they can be found, and are there any hints regarding what suitable replacement values might be) at an early stage. More advanced statistics (that are potentially derailed by missing values) should wait until after you have dealt with the missing values, using the procedures described in the EDA notes and notebooks given in class.</p>
<h3>Data mining ethics</h3>
<p>Data mining ethics includes respecting privacy, but it also relates to the purpose of use - just because you have the tools to do something, is it something that would benefit humanity (or the environment....) or not?</p>
<p><strong>We advise students to make at least one comment about the ethics of their proposed data investigation as part of their Assessment 1 submission.</strong></p>
